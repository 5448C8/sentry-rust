# Sentry Types

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sentry-types.svg?style=flat)](https://crates.io/crates/sentry-types)

This library implements Rust types for the Sentry v7 protocol as well as some other
common types that are useful when working with Sentry (like DSNs and so forth).

## Requirements

We currently only verify this crate against a recent version of Sentry hosted on
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) but it should work with on-prem Sentry versions
8.20 and later.

Additionally, the lowest Rust version we target is _1.40.0_.
